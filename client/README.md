This is a React-based Fantasy Football Application. It utilizes React components that work with helper/util functions and uses the React mounting lifecycle for the User to choose six Players from either team in a one game showdown.  The User will accrue points by Player based on the Player's performance yards and/or TDâ€™s.  The end goal is for the User to compete/compare their end game totals with other Users.  Node, Express and MongoDB are also utilized in this application
